h1. groups.plist (draft)

| *File Format* | Property List |

This file contains the definitions of arbitrary groups of glyphs. This file is optional. If it is not defined in the UFO, there is no group data.

h2. Specification

The property list data consists of a dictionary at the top level. Keys are group names and values are arrays of glyph name strings. There is no standard for naming groups. Glyphs may be in more than one group. Glyphs listed in the arrays are not required to be in the font.

h4. Special Considerations

Some groups may be used in kerning. See the "kerning.plist documentation":kerning.html for more information and special considerations.

<div class="discussionnote">

Should we state that the kerning prefixes should not be used for any groups other than kerning groups? We would need to state that this does not mean that only groups that are members of pairs in kerning.plist. Rather, it means that only groups that *could be* used in kerning pairs should use the prefixes.

We might also want to state that a glyph must not appear in more than one group per kerning side.
