h1. images directory (draft)

Images files may be stored within the UFO or not. If they are stored within the UFO, they must be stored in an _images_ directory at the top of the UFO. Obviously, each image must have a unique file name. However, beyond that there are no file name requirements. Applications should try to prevent duplicate images, but this is not a requirement of the UFO format. Applications should also try to remove unreferenced images from the images directory, but this is not a requirement of the UFO format.

<div class="discussionnote">
We are debating whether the specification should allow only one image type (PNG), a set of image types or any image types. One image type or a set of image types will be easiest for implementations. Any image type will be easiest for users, but could raise some implementation compatibility problems.

<div class="implementationnote">
It seems that the easiest way to implement things would be to require one specific image type. Trying to support more than one image type sounds like a heap of conversion trouble. PNG is documented and widely supported. It is RGB only, but so are the color specifications in this document.
