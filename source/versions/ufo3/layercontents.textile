h1. layercontents.plist (draft)

| *File Format* | "XML Property List":http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd |

This file maps the layer names to the _glyphs_ directory names. Those directory names must be plain directory names, not absolute or relative paths in the file system. Care must be taken when choosing file names: layer names are case sensitive, yet many file systems are not. There is no one standard layer name to file name conversion. However, a common implementation is defined in the "conventions":conventions.html#usernametofilename.

<div class="discussionnote">
Are there any rules governing what characters can be used in a layer name?

Can more than one layer have the same name?

Should we have some common names for exchanging layers? For example, FontLab has "mask", Fog had "background", FontForge has something else. They all have the same conceptual purpose. Allowing the free exchange of these despite the inconsistent UI name would be useful. We could do this through a small registry using the public.*syntax or we could add some information to a list of application interaction recommendations.

h2. Specification

The mapping is stored as an array in the property list. This array also defines the order of the layers from top to bottom. The mapping is stored within the array as arrays containing the layer names first and the directory name second.
