	<h1>Glyphs Directory (draft)</h1>

	<p>
		A glyphs directory represents a layer of glyph data in a font. This glyph data files will be in <a href="glif.html">Glyph Interchange Format (GLIF) Version 2</a> or GLIF 1 (<a href="../ufo2/glif.html">defined in the UFO 2 specification</a>). It must contain at least one GLIF file and it must contain a <a href="#contents">contents.plist</a> file defining the file name to glyph name mapping. A <a href="#layerinfo">layerinfo.plist</a> file may be present defining various properties of the layer.
	</p>
	<p>
		A glyphs directory is not required to contain any glyph files. Even if no glyph files are present, the contents.plist file is still required.
	</p>

	<table class="evenColumns">
		<tr>
			<td><strong>File Format</strong></td>
			<td><a href="conventions.html#propertylist">XML Property List</a></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		<em>contents.plist</em> contains a dictionary that maps glyph names to GLIF file names.
	</p>
	<p>
		Glyph names may contain any character and they may be any length. Glyph names must be unique within the layer.
	</p>

	<h2>Specification</h2>
	<p>
		The property list data consists of a dictionary at the top level. The keys are glyph names and the values are file names.
	</p>
	<p>
		The file names must end with ".glif" and must begin with a string that is unique within the layer. The file names stored in the property list must be plain file names, not absolute or relative paths in the file system, and they must include the ".glif" extension. Care must be taken when choosing file names: glyph names are case sensitive, yet many file systems are not. There is no one standard glyph name to file name conversion. However, a common implementation is defined in the <a href="conventions.html#usernametofilename">conventions</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Authoring tools should preserve GLIF file names when writing into existing UFOs. This can be done by referencing the existing contents.plist before the write operation. The glyph name to file name mapping can then be referenced when creating new file names.
	</p>

		This file contains information about the layer. This file is optional. Not all values are required for a proper file.

	<h2>Specification</h2>

		The property list data consists of a dictionary at the top level. The keys and values are as follows.

			<th>description</th>
			<th>default value</th>

	<h3>Guideline Format</h3>

	<p>
		The guidelines are stored as dictionaries of the following format.
	</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>key</th>
			<th>value type</th>
			<th>description</th>
			<th>default value</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>x</td>
			<td>integer or float</td>
			<td>The 'x' coordinate. Optional if <code>y</code> is provided and <code>angle</code> is not provided. See below for details.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>y</td>
			<td>integer or float</td>
			<td>The 'y' coordinate. Optional if <code>x</code> is provided and <code>angle</code> is not provided. See below for details.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>angle</td>
			<td>integer or float</td>
			<td>The angle of the guideline. This must be an angle between 0 and 360 degrees in a clockwise direction from the horizontal. If <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> are not specified, <code>angle</code> must not be specified. See below for details.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>name</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>An arbitrary name for the guideline. This attribute is optional.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>color</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>The color that should be applied to the guideline. The format follows the <a href="#color">color definition</a> standard. This attribute is optional.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>identifier</td>
			<td>string</td>
			<td>Unique identifier for the guideline. This attribute is not required and should only be added to guidelines as needed. However, once an identifier has been assigned to a guideline it must not be unnecessarily removed or changed. Identifiers may be changed in incoming guidelines during editing operations such as "paste," but they should be maintained unless a duplicate identifier will be created. The identifier value must be unique within the layerinfo.plist guidelines list that the guideline belongs to but it is not required to be unique among the identifiers assigned to guidelines in glyphs, in any other layerinfo.plist or in fontinfo.plist. The identifier specification is detailed in the <a href="conventions.html#identifiers">conventions</a>.</td>
			<td>None</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		The guideline extends along <code>angle</code> to infinity in both directions out of the point defined by <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. If <code>y</code> and <code>angle</code> are omitted, the element represents a vertical guideline. If <code>x</code> and <code>angle</code> are omitted, the element represents a horizontal guideline. If <code>y</code> is omitted and <code>angle</code> is provided, <code>y</code> is zero. If <code>x</code> is omitted and <code>angle</code> is provided, <code>x</code> is zero.
